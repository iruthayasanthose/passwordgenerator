# Passwords Generator
> Passwords Generator is a web-app. It produce passwords using upto range of 16 characters in four different methods [only alphabets, only numbers, only symbols, and mix of all above three]. The UI was in dark-mode, because my personal prefernce is always dark colours and an average responsive to small screens. You can generate N number of random passwords using this webapp. Visit the link below.
